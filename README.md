This is a PointsPlus calculator written in jQuery. If you don't know what JavaScript, jQuery or HTML are, you can calculate points at http://pointsplusjs.vero.moe/, which has a working demo of this library with a mobile-friendly web interface.

## Frequently Asked Questions
### Usage
#### So, how do I use this?
Essentially, you invoke the function `pointsPlus(protein, carbs, fat, fibre)` with each of these variables in milligrams. This returns the PointsPlus value in integer value.

#### Why does this use milligrams instead of grams?
Simple: Because as a American and French citizen, I know that different languages have different decimal annotation. In France, we would use 33,8 where in the US, we would use 33.8. If this were broken down into milligrams from grams, it would be 33800.

### Updates?
#### What is your to-do list regarding this plugin?
- [ ] Finish up the plugin and release it.
- [ ] Create a HTML demo for the jQuery plugin.
- [ ] Add Points compatibility.
- [ ] Add SmartPoints compatibility.

#### Will this eventually calculate Points and SmartPoints?
Yes. It’s on my to do list.

### PointsPlus and WeightWatchers
#### What is « PointsPlus »?
PointsPlus is a unit of measurement created by WeightWatchers for use in their programme. It has since been replaced by SmartPoints.

#### Why don’t you just use SmartPoints?
Some people like PointsPlus better than SmartPoints and have had better results with their weight loss. I know I did when I was in Weight Watchers. As such, this script exists to help those people continue to calculate food point values and use PointsPlus.

But why don’t I personally use SmartPoints? It’s because I don’t use WeightWatchers anymore. I’m seeking bariatric surgery to help with my weight loss journey.

#### Is this a violation of WeightWatchers’ rights?
No. The formula for PointsPlus is public knowledge and has been posted on many sites. 

1. I make no money from this website. I have added no adverts, attached this to no commercial service, and have no plans to do so now or in the future.
2. This website is a front-facing website for the open source project, pointsplus.js. As is an open source project, anyone can take the file and use it to calculate PointsPlus values according to the documentation.

## Documentation coming soon.
