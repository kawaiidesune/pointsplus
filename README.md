## Frequently Asked Questions
### What is « PointsPlus »?
PointsPlus is a unit of measurement created by WeightWatchers for use in their programme. It has since been replaced by SmartPoints.

### Why don’t you just use SmartPoints?
Some people like PointsPlus better than SmartPoints and have had better results with their weight loss. I know I did when I was in Weight Watchers. As such, this script exists to help those people continue to calculate food point values and use PointsPlus.

But why don’t I personally use SmartPoints? It’s because I don’t use WeightWatchers anymore. I’m seeking bariatric surgery to help with my weight loss journey.

## Documentation coming soon.
